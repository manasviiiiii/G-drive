# G-drive

**Decentralized Image Upload and Sharing**

G-drive is a decentralized platform for secure image upload and sharing on the blockchain. It uses Solidity smart contracts and React for the front-end interface, ensuring decentralized storage on IPFS and robust access control via Ethereum.

## Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Images are stored on IPFS, ensuring immutability and decentralization.
- **Smart Contract**: Manages ownership and access control on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Access Control**: Allows users to grant/revoke image access via smart contracts.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Smart contract development for ownership and access control.
- **React**: Front-end interface for uploading images and managing access.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage protocol for hosting uploaded images.
