Decentralized Image Upload and Sharing
This project facilitates decentralized image upload and sharing on the blockchain using Solidity for the smart contract and React for the front-end interface. It enables users to securely upload images to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and share access with specified users through smart contract functionality.
**#Features**
Decentralized Storage: Images are uploaded to IPFS, ensuring decentralized and immutable storage.
Smart Contract: Utilizes Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for access control and ownership management.
Access Control: Users can grant or revoke access to their uploaded images to specific individuals through the smart contract.
**#Technologies Used**
Solidity: Smart contract development for ownership and access control.
React: Front-end interface for uploading images and managing access.
IPFS: Decentralized storage protocol for hosting uploaded images.
