Decentralized Image Upload and Sharing
This project facilitates decentralized image upload and sharing on the blockchain using Solidity for the smart contract and React for the front-end interface. It enables users to securely upload images to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and share access with specified users through smart contract functionality.
